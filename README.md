# PLEASE READ BEFORE CONTINUING
These files are from programming basics 2 class of 2018 and I made those solutions.
**REMINDER : NOT ALL SOLUTION FOLDERS ARE ACTUALLY THE CORRECT ONES (SCORE:100),**
**THOSE WERE JUST MY SOLUTIONS FROM BACK THEN AND (MAYBE) SOME OF THEM ARE BROKEN**
I wish anyone who accessed this could use this repo to train their programming skills.
Sorry for my (bad) programming.
Have fun!
